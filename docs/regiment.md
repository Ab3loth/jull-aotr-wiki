# ⚔️ Regiment

Welcome to the **Regiment** page! This is where you'll find details about both the **Main Regiment** and the **Junior Regiment**.

## <a name="main-regiment"></a>🛡️ **Main Regiment**

The **Main Regiment** is for players who are ready to **push their limits** and compete at the highest level. This regiment is for those who want to prove their mastery and be egoist crackheads.

### Requirements

__**Complete a Sub 2:30 Outskirts Run** under the following **mission modifiers**:__

 - **No Skills** enabled.
 - **No Talents** enabled.

__**Additional Restrictions**:__

 - **No Hoarding** (don’t group up all the titans).
 - **No Heavenly Restriction abuse** (this perk is literally just luck).
 - **No timer abuse** (no delaying the first kill to pause the timer).

**Clip Submission:** You must submit a **full clip** of the run to **an admin on the discord** with evidence of the above mission modifiers being used.

> **Mobile Players**: Your time requirement is **Sub 3:00**, with the same restrictions applied.

Joining the Main Regiment is about consistently challenging yourself and improving your skills. Don't try to cheese your runs, it won't benefit you or us in any way.

## <a name="junior-regiment"></a>🎯 **Junior Regiment**

The **Junior Regiment** is a **buffer** for players who are still learning or not yet ready for the Main Regiment. This is the place to **train** and **build the foundation** for moving up.

There are no strict entry requirements here **anyone can join**. It’s a place to chill and prepare for the Main Regiment.

While this regiment doesn’t have the same entry barriers, we encourage players to take the time to **improve** and **push their limits**. Once you’re ready, the Main Regiment will be waiting for you.
